## About me

Welcome to my personal website! My name is Mariana V. Ramírez Bustamante. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Comparative Politics and Political Methodology in the [Department of Political Science](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/) and a Graduate Researcher Affiliate in the [LAPOP Lab](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/) at Vanderbilt University. I hold a B.A. in Political Science and Government from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, an M.A. in Political Science from Vanderbilt University, and an M.A. in Latin American Studies from Salamanca University (Spain). 
  
My previous work led me to consider how illegal drug trafficking and related patterns of criminal governance shape social and political interactions. My dissertation project addresses how this illicit economy and related actors influence vote choice, as well as citizens’ attitudes toward local authority and democracy more broadly. Exploring how criminal dynamics play a role in local politics is valuable if we are to better understand why narco-linked candidates get elected at the local level, and the political dynamics in areas dominated by this type of illicit economy. Studying the extent to which individuals’ perceptions toward the political regime are (re)shaped by criminal organizations has implications for how knowing democracy works at a local level.
