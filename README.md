- Welcome! My name is Mariana Ramírez Bustamante. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Comparative Politics and Political Methodology in the Department of Political Science and a Graduate Researcher Affiliate in the LAPOP Lab at Vanderbilt University. I hold a B.A. in Political Science and Government from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, an M.A. in Political Science from Vanderbilt University, and another M.A. in Latin American Studies from Salamanca University (Spain). 

- My research interests include the comparative study of illegal economies, particularly drug trafficking, and citizens' political behavior with an emphasis on the Latin American region. My dissertation project addresses why voters support narco-linked candidates, and, in turn, how drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) shape citizens’ political attitudes. To investigate these topics, I leverage original data from experiments, and observational data, including survey data and in-depth semi-structured interviews. My other ongoing projects or published work explore electoral behavior, representation, and public opinion more broadly.

- For questions, comments, or drafts of working papers, I can be reached at mariana.v.ramirez.bustamante@vanderbilt.edu. You can find my current CV here.
